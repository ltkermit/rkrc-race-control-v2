## Features:
- Select race length from 1 to 10 minutes.
- Three different announcer voices.
- Race with or without a steward.
  - When racing without a steward, green flags are randomly thrown after clearing a flag.
  - When racing with a steward, green flags are thrown as soon the steward clears a flag.
- Audible time remaing callouts at every minute and the last 30 seconds.
- Practice mode can be enabled to disable the countdown.
- While a race is running your mobile screen will remain on.
- Red flags pause the timer.

## Apple iOS:
Do to security features in Safari, audio files do not play reliably. I recommend using Firefox on Apple devices.

I will continue to work on workarounds, but if anyone has epxerince with this, please send me a message.

## Development
Code written with major assistance from Grok3 and Claude 4 AI.
