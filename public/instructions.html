      <h1>Race Control Instructions</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to RKRC Race Control! This tool helps manage RC racing events
        with or without a steward. Below are instructions on how to use the
        program.
      </p>

      <h2>Getting Started - Single Device Mode</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose Mode:</strong> From the home page, select "Race with a
          Steward" for controlled races or "Race without a Steward" for
          automated flag clearing with random delays.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set Race Duration:</strong> Select the desired race time from
          the dropdown menu before starting the race.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Practice Mode:</strong> Enable Practice Mode to run a race without a countdown timer; flags will still work.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Set Race Announcer:</strong> Select the desired announcer voice from
          the dropdown menu before starting the race.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Start the Race:</strong> Click the "Start Race" button to
          begin. Youâ€™ll hear "Start your engines" followed by 4 beeps, and a
          final start beep signals the race start.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Getting Started - Multi-Device Mode (Beta)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Choose Multi-Device Mode:</strong> From the home page, select "Race Director" to control the race or "Spectator View" to observe the race status in real-time across multiple devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Race Director Setup:</strong> As a director, you'll need to authenticate with a password (provided by the race organizer) when accessing the "Race Director" page. Once authenticated, you can control the race similar to single-device mode, and your actions will be broadcast to all connected spectators.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spectator Setup:</strong> As a spectator, select "Spectator View" and enter a name (optional). You'll see the race status, timer, and flags in real-time as updated by the director. You can toggle audio announcements on or off.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Connection Status:</strong> Both directors and spectators will see a connection status bar at the top of the page indicating if they are connected and, for directors, if they are authenticated.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>During the Race - Single Device Mode</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Timer:</strong> The countdown timer displays the remaining
          race time. Audio cues play at key intervals (e.g., every minute starting from 1 minute, and at 30 seconds remaining).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Yellow Flag:</strong> Click "Yellow Flag" to signal caution
          (background turns yellow). Click "Clear Yellow Flag" to return to
          green. In "No Steward" mode, clearing has a random delay of 3-6
          seconds after a "Get Ready" sound.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Red Flag:</strong> Click "Red Flag" to stop the race
          (background turns red, timer pauses). Click "Clear Red Flag" to
          resume. In "No Steward" mode, clearing has a random delay of 3-6
          seconds after a "Get Ready" sound.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>During the Race - Multi-Device Mode (Beta)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Race Director Control:</strong> Directors control the race as in single-device mode. Actions like starting the race, toggling flags, or changing announcer voice are broadcast to all connected spectators in real-time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Spectator View:</strong> Spectators see the race timer, flag status, and background color updates synchronized with the director's actions. Audio announcements can be enabled or disabled via a checkbox.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Connected Devices:</strong> Directors can see a list of connected devices (spectators and themselves) to monitor participation.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ending or Restarting</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Race End:</strong> When the timer reaches 0, the race ends
          with a final sound, and a checkerboard background appears. In multi-device mode, this is synchronized across all connected devices.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Restart:</strong> Click "Restart" at any time to reset the
          race or to start a new race. In multi-device mode, this action by the director resets the state for all spectators.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Home:</strong> Click "Home" at any time to <strong>stop
            everything</strong> and take you back to the main menu. Note: In multi-device mode, directors leaving the page may disrupt the race for spectators.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          For races without a steward, the random delay in clearing flags adds
          unpredictability to simulate a real race steward.
        </li>
        <li>
          For races with a steward, the steward will determine when the flag
          goes green.
        </li>
        <li>
          In multi-device mode, ensure a stable internet connection for real-time synchronization between director and spectators.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your device's screen will stay on while a race is running, so be sure
          to have a good charge.
        </li>
        <li>Ensure your device volume is on to hear audio cues, especially for spectators who have enabled audio announcements.</li>
        <li>
          At the end of each race, a summary of flags thrown will be displayed.
        </li>
        <li>If you have questions, contact the race organizer.</li>
